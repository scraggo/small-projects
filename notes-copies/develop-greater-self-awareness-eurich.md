How to Develop Greater Self-Awareness

Guest: Tasha Eurich, and she’s an organizational psychologist and the author of _Insight: Why We’re Not as Self-Aware as We Think, and How Seeing Ourselves Clearly Helps Us Succeed at Work and in Life_. Tasha kicks off our conversation by arguing that our level of self-awareness sets the upper limit of our individual effectiveness and that self-awareness can be developed and is truly the meta skill of the 21st century.

## 2 parts to self awareness

1 - internal
- you know your values, goals, desires
- Internal only: introspective type, leads to self-absorption

2 - external
- you understand how people will react to you
- External only: pleaser type

These parts are learned separately

## 7 Pillars of self-knowledge

1. values
2. passions
3. aspirations, achievements and experiences
4. fit - environment and people and do they give energy
5. patterns
6. reactions, triggers
7. impact on others

You can get internal and external feedback for all pillars, even values which are very personal.

Ask yourself questions for each one. For instance "What are my values?"

Unexpected events (getting fired, medical issue) are data points you can learn from

## Daily checkin: (leads to incremental improvements)

- What went well
- What didn't go well
- What can I do to be smarter tomorrow?

You don't necessarily need to journal. Just ask these questions.

## Biases / blind spots

Only 10-15% of people are truly self aware. But most of us think we're already self awareness:

> 95% of people say that they’re self-aware. But only 10-15% of people actually are. As my guest today says, that means “on a good day, 80% of us are lying to ourselves about how much we’re lying to ourselves” and this blind spot can have big repercussions for our success and happiness.

Have a "There's always more to learn" mindset

## "Be an _informer_ not a _me-former_"

Alternative to ego based social media: enrich other's lives instead of showing off

Social media can be egotistical, cult of self / narcissism, self importance.

## "What" not "Why"

Introspection the wrong way makes you less self aware. Less happy, less in control. Many things about ourselves are unknowable. We often confuse current feelings with the cause of what happened. (Fight caused by being hungry)

So don't ask yourself a "why" question! Ask a "what" question. What can I do differently in the future? It's more analytical.

"Why" is emotional and past focused. Rumination, rabbit hole.
Journaling can be very limited in effectiveness. You don't need to do it often.

## Mindfulness through compare-and-contrast

Meditation isn't necessary to be mindful.

Do a "Compare and contrast" exercise. Example: why do I get bored every 2 years into a job? Compare to the past job experiences - contrast with the non-employment experiences.

## Get feedback in a strategic way

Improving External awareness. How to get feedback from others. Can feel criticized.

### Loving critics

Get feedback from 3-5 people. These people must meet two criteria:
- is this person on my side?
- Do I feel like this person going to tell me the truth? Loving critics.

Ask for 5 min a month feedback on some skill you're working on.
- Ask: How'd I do?
- Ask: What to do for next 30 days?
- Thank them, don't say what you think of their feedback.

Dinner of truth. What do I do that's most annoying to you? (What do you have to "work on?")

### unsolicited feedback

Don't necessarily buy into unsolicited feedback - you don't know the other's motives. Also, don't act on it for a while, put it in the back of your mind. Look into it on your own timeline. Get a wider sample - Ask loving critics if that's true.

## Work on one behavioral goal at a time. Build them into habits
