## Highlights

Chapter 1
- the backwards law - trying harder makes it worse

Chapter 2
- We avoid problems through: Denial and Victim Mentality.
  - chasing the highs that result from ^
- > Happiness Comes from Solving Problems
- problems never go away, you can only exchange worse problems for better problems

Chapter 3
- entitlement: assuming we're special by being uniquely great or defective in some way
- the media normalizes the exceptional
- > few of us ever become truly exceptional at more than one thing
  - b/c it's time consuming and difficult
- > simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about.
  - these things are far more important than being special. They are _not_ special, merely ordinary

Chapter 4
- examining suffering - opportunities to get at our deepest values, the root reasons for the suffering
- having "Shitty Values" causes and perpetuates suffering
- self-improvement is about prioritizing values

\* five counterintuitive values:

> 1. (Chapter 5) a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault.
> 2. (Chapter 6) uncertainty: the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs.
> 3. (Chapter 7) failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon.
> 4. (Chapter 8) rejection: the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life.
> 5. (Chapter 9) the contemplation of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective.

Chapter 5
- by choosing our problems (an attribute of our chosen values), we suffer less
- taking responsibility for our problems expands our agency
- "victimhood chic" in our culture is prevalent

Chapter 6
- you can never be "right." you can only get slightly less wrong.
- > the backwards law: the more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel.
- we cling to our wrong ideas b/c testing them is difficult, and challenges our identities
  - > Manson’s Law of Avoidance - The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.
- 3 questions, last one being:
  - > Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?

Chapter 7
- failure leads to growth. (quantity over quantity!)
- > Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.
- act and motivation will follow (don't wait for motivation)

Chapter 8
- > to value something, we must reject what is not that something. To value X, we must reject non-X.
- unhealthy relationships - the "victim" and "saver" dynamic
  - question to test if your relationship is conditional, basically, can you reject each other without jeopardizing the relationship?
- freedom can be commitment:
  - > pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to experience the rewards of depth of experience.

Chapter 9
- immortality projects:
  - are attempts at living forever by creating a conceptual self that can live forever
  - positive: they encapsulate what we value, can be noble
  - negative: they're a response to the fear of death, often pathological and sadistic
- "memento mori" - to keep this death-centered meaning in mind
- meditation as a "little death" - releasing attachment as a mechanism for positive change
- > Death is the only thing we can know with any certainty.
  - this fact obviously creates problems like the fear of death, but also solves problems - meaning only exists in the face of death

## 1 - Don't Try

Quotes:
on Bukowski's tombstone, the epitaph reads: "Don't try."

And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but from the fact that he knew he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in Bukowski's work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself—especially the worst parts of himself—and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt.

no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she's happy. She just is.

**The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.**

Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. **It's what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as "the backwards law"—the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.** The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance.

Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
- ...finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. Because if you don't find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes.

S0:

The fixation on what's better and superior serves as a constant reminder of what we are not. It reinforces the idea of what you lack and what you should have been but failed to be. By giving too many fucks, you become overly attached to the superficial and fake and live life chasing a mirage of happiness and satisfaction.

> "The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it's giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important."

Dedicate your fucks only to what's truly fuck-worthy. Choose what's important to you and give a fuck about that. Less is more. We no longer face a material crisis, but rather an existential and spiritual one. Because there are many things we can now see or know, there is also an infinite number of ways to discover we are not good enough and things aren't as great as they could be. Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experiences. Accepting your experience of life as being great and wonderful is the single greatest thing you can do for your happiness.

> "The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience."

**The Feedback Loop From Hell:**

Giving too many fucks about things that don't matter makes us feel bad about ourselves. This leads to the Feedback Loop From Hell: you feel a certain feeling for some reason (or no obvious reason at all) and having this feeling makes you feel even worse. For example: You get pissed off because your spouse hasn't thanked you for washing the dishes. You realize you are pissed off for a tiny matter and that again pisses you off even more. Now you're pissed off about yourself being pissed off. The solution is to not give a fuck about negative experiences (anxiety, anger, guilt, fear etc.). It's okay having these feelings and feel like shit sometimes. Don't make it worse by beating yourself up for feeling that way.

> "By not giving a fuck that you feel bad, you short-circuit the Feedback Loop from Hell; you say to yourself, ‘I feel like shit, but who gives a fuck?' And then, as if sprinkled by magic fuck-giving fairy dust, you stop hating yourself for feeling so bad."

**The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck:**

Here's Manson's definition of not giving a fuck means:

- It's not about being indifferent, but being comfortable with being different
- To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first care about something more important than adversity
- You are always choosing what to give a fuck about. The key is to gradually cut the things you care about so that you only give a fuck on the most important of occasions

## 2 - Happiness Is a Problem

About twenty-five hundred years ago, in the Himalayan foothills of present-day Nepal, there lived in a great palace a king who was going to have a son. For this son the king had a particularly grand idea: he would make the child's life perfect. The child would never know a moment of suffering—every need, every desire, would be accounted for at all times.

...

Years later, the prince would build his own philosophy and share it with the world, and this would be its first and central tenet: **that pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them.** ... Buddha.

Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature...

The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda

If I could invent a superhero, I would invent one called Disappointment Panda. He'd wear a cheesy eye mask and a shirt (with a giant capital T on it) that was way too small for his big panda belly, and his superpower would be to tell people harsh truths about themselves that they needed to hear but didn't want to accept.

We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature's preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because **it's the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that's going to do the most work to innovate and survive.** We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no—our own pain and misery aren't a bug of human evolution; they're a feature.

And this pain, as much as we hate it, is useful. Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when we're young or careless. It helps show us what's good for us versus what's bad for us. It helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations. It teaches us to not fuck around near hot stoves or stick metal objects into electrical sockets. Therefore, it's not always beneficial to avoid pain and seek pleasure, since pain can, at times, be life-or-death important to our well-being.

humans are capable of experiencing acute psychological pain as well.

problems never cease

"Don't hope for a life without problems," the panda said. "There's no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems."

Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

Problems are a constant in life. ...buying a gym membership -> having to get up early to get to the gym on time...

not spending enough time with your partner -> figuring out what to do every Wednesday that you both won't hate...

**Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded.**

Happiness is ... a form of action (not a "state" or a status-achieved)

(Problem-solving preventers:)
- Denial.
- Victim Mentality.
- (chasing the highs that result from ^)

Emotions Are Overrated
...negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it's because you're supposed to do something. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. When you feel them, life seems simple and there is nothing else to do but enjoy it.

to deny one's negative emotions is to deny many of the feedback mechanisms that help a person solve problems. As a result, many of these repressed individuals struggle to deal with problems throughout their lives.

_hedonic treadmill_ - emotions never last. Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow, because our biology always needs something more. (we'll adapt to what made us happy - those things eventually bring us conflicts)

Choose Your Struggle

Real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles.

(wanting to be a rock star - I can relate to this!)
The truth is, I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn't. End of story. I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory. And life doesn't work that way.

See: it's a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you're allowed to stop climbing, I'm afraid you're missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.

S1:

Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

- Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress
- True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.

Choose Your Struggle

- A more interesting question, a question that most people never consider, is, "What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?" Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.
- Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.

## 3 - You Are Not Special

I once knew a guy; we'll call him Jimmy.

Jimmy always had various business ventures going. ... The guy was always rolling, always on, and if you gave him an inch of conversational daylight, he'd pulverize you about how world-spinning his work was, how brilliant his latest ideas were, and he'd name-drop so much it felt like you were talking to a tabloid reporter.

(He was actually a liar) People who pointed out his deadbeat lifestyle were "jealous"; they were "haters" who envied his success.

The worst part was that Jimmy believed his own bullshit. His delusion was so bulletproof, it was honestly hard to get mad at him, it was actually kind of amazing.

Sometime in the 1960s, developing "high self-esteem"—having positive thoughts and feelings about oneself—became all the rage in psychology. ... Participation awards and bogus trophies were invented for any number of mundane and expected activities.

adversity and failure are actually useful and even necessary for developing strong-minded and successful adults. ... teaching people to believe they're exceptional and to feel good about themselves no matter what doesn't lead to a population full of Bill Gateses and Martin Luther Kings. It leads to a population full of Jimmys.

a true and accurate measurement of one's self-worth is how people feel about the negative aspects of themselves.

But the problem with entitlement is that it makes people need to feel good about themselves all the time, even at the expense of those around them. And because entitled people always need to feel good about themselves, they end up spending most of their time thinking about themselves.

People who feel entitled view every occurrence in their life as either an affirmation of, or a threat to, their own greatness.

**entitlement is a failed strategy. It's just another high.** It's not happiness.

A person who actually has a high self-worth is able to look at the negative parts of his character frankly—"Yes, sometimes I'm irresponsible with money," "Yes, sometimes I exaggerate my own successes," "Yes, I rely too much on others to support me and should be more self-reliant"—and then acts to improve upon them. But entitled people, because they are incapable of acknowledging their own problems openly and honestly, are incapable of improving their lives in any lasting or meaningful way. They are left chasing high after high and accumulate greater and greater levels of denial.

Things Fall Apart

(Author, as a 13-year old in biology class - got caught with weed - parents got strict with him - they divorced 9 months later - lots of trauma)

When "real traumatic shit" like this happens in our lives, we begin to unconsciously feel as though we have problems that we're incapable of ever solving. And this assumed inability to solve our problems causes us to feel miserable and helpless.

But it also causes something else to happen. **If we have problems that are unsolvable, our unconscious figures that we're either uniquely special or uniquely defective in some way.** That we're somehow unlike everyone else and that the rules must be different for us.

Put simply: we become entitled.

(Author, addicted to pursuing women:) My trauma had revolved around intimacy and acceptance, so I felt a constant need to overcompensate, to prove to myself that I was loved and accepted at all times.

The deeper the pain, the more helpless we feel against our problems, and the more entitlement we adopt to compensate for those problems. This entitlement plays out in one of two ways:

1. I'm awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment.
2. I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment.

you're not special.

Often, it's this realization—that you and your problems are actually not privileged in their severity or pain—that is the first and most important step toward solving them.

(Modern times / tech:) The more exposed we are to opposing viewpoints, the more we seem to get upset that those other viewpoints exist.

The Tyranny of Exceptionalism

Most of us are pretty average at most things we do. Even if you're exceptional at one thing, chances are you're average or below average at most other things. That's just the nature of life. To become truly great at something, you have to dedicate shit-tons of time and energy to it. And **because we all have limited time and energy, few of us ever become truly exceptional at more than one thing, if anything at all.**

We're all, for the most part, pretty average people. But it's the extremes that get all of the publicity. We kind of know this already, but we rarely think and/or talk about it, and we certainly never discuss why this could be a problem.

All day, every day, we are flooded with the truly extraordinary. The best of the best. The worst of the worst. The greatest physical feats. The funniest jokes. The most upsetting news. The scariest threats. Nonstop.

Our lives today are filled with information from the extremes of the bell curve of human experience, because in the media business that's what gets eyeballs, and eyeballs bring dollars. That's the bottom line. Yet the vast majority of life resides in the humdrum middle. The vast majority of life is unextraordinary, indeed quite average.

This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal. ... We cope the only way we know how: either through self-aggrandizing or through other-aggrandizing.

Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems. The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame.

B-b-b-but, If I'm Not Going to Be Special or Extraordinary, What's the Point?

People who become great at something become great because they understand that they're not already great—they are mediocre, they are average—and that they could be so much better.

All of this "every person can be extraordinary and achieve greatness" stuff is basically just jerking off your ego. It's a message that tastes good going down, but in reality is nothing more than empty calories that make you emotionally fat and bloated, the proverbial Big Mac for your heart and your brain.

The ticket to emotional health, like that to physical health, comes from eating your veggies—that is, accepting the bland and mundane truths of life: truths such as "Your actions actually don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things" and "The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that's okay." This vegetable course will taste bad at first. Very bad. You will avoid accepting it.

You will have a **growing appreciation for life's basic experiences:** the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about.

Sounds boring, doesn't it? That's because these things are ordinary. But maybe **they're ordinary for a reason: because they are what actually matters.**

## 4 - The Value of Suffering

(1944 - Hiroo Onoda was given an order - to never surrender to Americans. He stayed in the jungle for ~30 years, killing villagers, refusing to believe the war was over. Suzuki decided to try to find him. He did. He died later in search of the Abominable Snowman)

These men both chose how they wished to suffer. Hiroo Onoda chose to suffer for loyalty to a dead empire. Suzuki chose to suffer for adventure, no matter how ill-advised. To both men, their suffering meant something; it fulfilled some greater cause. And because it meant something, they were able to endure it, or perhaps even enjoy it.

And in the irony of ironies, Onoda became far more depressed than he’d ever been in the jungle for all those years. At least in the jungle his life had stood for something; it had meant something. That had made his suffering endurable, indeed even a little bit desirable. But back in Japan, in what he considered to be a vacuous nation full of hippies and loose women in Western clothing, he was confronted with the unavoidable truth: that his fighting had meant nothing. The Japan he had lived and fought for no longer existed. And the weight of this realization pierced him in a way that no bullet ever had. Because his suffering had meant nothing, it suddenly became realized and true: thirty years wasted.

The Self-Awareness Onion

Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times.

Let’s say **the first layer of the self-awareness onion is a simple understanding of one’s emotions.** (Those who suck at this level were taught certain emotions are "bad")

**The second layer of the self-awareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions.**

This layer of questioning helps us understand the root cause of the emotions that overwhelm us. Once we understand that root cause, we can ideally do something to change it.

**The third level is our personal values:** Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?
- because our values determine the nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives.

For many people (blaming external causes) passes as self-awareness. And yet, if they were able to go deeper and look at their underlying values, they would see that their original analysis was based on avoiding responsibility for their own problem, rather than accurately identifying the problem. They would see that their decisions were based on chasing highs, not generating true happiness.

(Author examines his relationship with his brother. His bro doesn't respond to his texts. He sees himself as a failure, "normal" brothers stay in close contact. He has rigged it so that the metrics he's using make him feel like a loser. Better to change how he sees the relationship - dig into those values.)

Rock Star Problems

Dave Mustaine, whether he realized it or not, chose to measure himself by whether he was more successful and popular than Metallica. The experience of getting thrown out of his former band was so painful for him that he adopted "success relative to Metallica" as the metric by which to measure himself and his music career.

If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.

(Pete Best got kicked out of the Beatles.) ... ultimately led him to meet his wife. And then his marriage led him to having children. His values changed. He began to measure his life differently. Fame and glory would have been nice, sure—but he decided that what he already had was more important: a big and loving family, a stable marriage, a simple life. He even still got to play drums, touring Europe and recording albums well into the 2000s. So what was really lost? Just a lot of attention and adulation, whereas what was gained meant so much more to him.

Shitty Values

There are a handful of common values that create really poor problems for people—problems that can hardly be solved. So let’s go over some of them quickly:

1. Pleasure
2. Material Success. (money, cars, prettier lawn than the neighbors...happiness increases until a certain salary.) The other issue with overvaluing material success is the danger of prioritizing it over other values, such as honesty, nonviolence, and compassion.
3. Always Being Right. ... As humans, we’re wrong pretty much constantly, so if your metric for life success is to be right—well, you’re going to have a difficult time rationalizing all of the bullshit to yourself. (Have a growth mindset, be open minded.)
4. Staying Positive. ... Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a valid solution to life’s problems. The trick with negative emotions is to 1) express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and 2) express them in a way that aligns with your values.

As Freud once said, "One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful."

This is why these values—pleasure, material success, always being right, staying positive—are poor ideals for a person’s life. **Some of the greatest moments of one’s life are not pleasant, not successful, not known, and not positive.**

The point is to nail down some good values and metrics, and pleasure and success will naturally emerge as a result. These things are side effects of good values. By themselves, they are empty highs.

\* Defining Good and Bad Values

_Good values_ are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable.

_Bad values_ are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate or controllable.
- (striving for _popularity_ is bad, it's out of control, not based in reality)

good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.

bad, unhealthy values: dominance through manipulation or violence, indiscriminate fucking, feeling good all the time, always being the center of attention, not being alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich ...

**Values are about prioritization.** ... What are the values that you prioritize above everything else, and that therefore influence your decision-making more than anything else?

This ... is what "self-improvement" is really about: prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about. Because when you give better fucks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life.

The rest of this book is dedicated to **five counterintuitive values** that I believe are the most beneficial values one can adopt. All follow the "backwards law" we talked about earlier, in that they’re "negative." All require confronting deeper problems rather than avoiding them through highs. These five values are both unconventional and uncomfortable. But, to me, they are life-changing.

1. a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault.
2. uncertainty: the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs.
3. failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon.
4. rejection: the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life.
5. the contemplation of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective.

## 5 - You Are Always Choosing

Often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it, and that we are responsible for it.

If you’re miserable in your current situation, chances are it’s because you feel like some part of it is outside your control—that there’s a problem you have no ability to solve, a problem that was somehow thrust upon you without your choosing.

**When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered.** When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable.

The Choice

(William James, influenced by) philosopher Charles Peirce, James decided to conduct a little experiment. In his diary, he wrote that he would spend one year believing that he was 100 percent responsible for everything that occurred in his life, no matter what. During this period, he would do everything in his power to change his circumstances, no matter the likelihood of failure. If nothing improved in that year, then it would be apparent that he was truly powerless to the circumstances around him, and then he would take his own life. (He became immensely successful after that.)

we are always choosing, whether we recognize it or not. Always.

The real question is, What are we choosing to give a fuck about? What values are we choosing to base our actions on? What metrics are we choosing to use to measure our life? And are those good choices—good values and good metrics?

The Responsibility/Fault Fallacy

"With great power comes great responsibility." ... there’s a better version of this quote ...: "With great responsibility comes great power."

A lot of people hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be responsible for your problems is to also be at fault for your problems.

Responsibility and fault often appear together in our culture. But they’re not the same thing.

Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense.

(Author example: girlfriend cheated on him and left him. He was miserable for months. He finally took responsibility for his happiness, started taking care of himself again.)

I hadn’t exactly been the Boyfriend of the Year to her either. ... These things were my fault too.

My ex leaving me, while one of the most painful experiences I’ve ever had, was also one of the most important and influential experiences of my life. I credit it with inspiring a significant amount of personal growth.

\* ... taking responsibility for our _problems_ is far more important (than successes), because that’s where the real learning comes from.

Responding to Tragedy

(Man's son dies, gets mad at author) - The responsibility for coping with that loss was given to him even though it was clearly and understandably unwanted. But despite all that, he was still responsible for his own emotions, beliefs, and actions. How he reacted to his son’s death was his own choice. Pain of one sort or another is inevitable for all of us, but we get to choose what it means to and for us.

Genetics and the Hand We’re Dealt

In 2013, the BBC rounded up half a dozen teenagers with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and followed them as they attended intensive therapies to help them overcome their unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors.

And, as we’ll see, managing the disorder comes down to managing one’s values.

With these new values held front and center in their minds, the teenagers set out on intensive desensitization exercises that force them to live out their new values. Panic attacks ensue; tears are shed; Jack punches an array of inanimate objects and then immediately washes his hands. But by the end of the documentary, major progress has been made.

(Poker:) A person can get dealt terrible cards and beat someone who was dealt great cards.

Victimhood Chic

The public sharing of "injustices" garners far more attention and emotional outpouring than most other events on social media, rewarding people who are able to perpetually feel victimized with ever-growing amounts of attention and sympathy.

"Victimhood chic" is in style on both the right and the left today, among both the rich and the poor.

The writer and media commentator Ryan Holiday refers to this as "outrage porn"

These "democratic" values are harder to maintain amidst the constant noise of a networked world. But we must accept the responsibility and nurture them regardless. The future stability of our political systems may depend on it.

There Is No "How"

Let’s look at some of these side effects.
- You’re going to feel uncertain;
- Next, you’ll feel like a failure. You’ve spent half your life measuring yourself by that old value, so when you change your priorities, change your metrics, and stop behaving in the same way, you’ll fail to meet that old, trusted metric and thus immediately feel like some sort of fraud or nobody.
- And certainly you will weather rejections. Many of the relationships in your life were built around the values you’ve been keeping, so the moment you change those values—the moment you decide that studying is more important than partying, that getting married and having a family is more important than rampant sex, that working a job you believe in is more important than money—your turnaround will reverberate out through your relationships, and many of them will blow up in your face. This too is normal and this too will be uncomfortable.

## 6 - You’re Wrong About Everything (But So Am I)

Every step of the way I was wrong. About everything. Throughout my life, I’ve been flat-out wrong about myself, others, society, culture, the world, the universe—everything.

And I hope that will continue to be the case for the rest of my life.

Just as Present Mark can look back on Past Mark’s every flaw and mistake, one day Future Mark will look back on Present Mark’s assumptions (including the contents of this book) and notice similar flaws. And that will be a good thing. Because that will mean I have grown.

Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from "wrong" to "right." Rather, **we go from wrong to slightly less wrong.**

When viewed from this perspective, personal growth can actually be quite scientific. Our values are our hypotheses: this behavior is good and important; that other behavior is not. Our actions are the experiments; the resulting emotions and thought patterns are our data.

**It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents, than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sure.**

Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt: doubt about our own beliefs, doubt about our own feelings, doubt about what the future may hold for us unless we get out there and create it for ourselves. Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are.

Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth. It means not cutting your arm open to cure a cold or splashing dog piss on your face to look young again. It means not thinking "mediocre" is a vegetable, and not being afraid to care about things.

Architects of Our Own Beliefs

(experiment: subjects pressed buttons until they got a ding for a point. They thought there was a pattern to figure out.) But here’s the funny part: the points really are random. There’s no sequence; there’s no pattern. ... the point of the experiment is to show how quickly the human mind is capable of coming up with and believing in a bunch of bullshit that isn’t real.

Be Careful What You Believe

(journalist and feminist author Meredith Maran was convinced that she was sexually abused by her father. Turns out she wasn't - that false memory was formed as a result of years of developing beliefs.)

Not only does our memory suck—suck to the point that eyewitness testimony isn’t necessarily taken seriously in court cases—but our brain functions in a horribly biased way.

Every new piece of information is measured against the values and conclusions we already have. As a result, our brain is always biased toward what we feel to be true in that moment.

(when our current experience doesn't match our past beliefs:)
In an effort to achieve coherence, our mind will sometimes, in cases like that, invent false memories.

false memory syndrome.

... perhaps the answer is to trust yourself less. After all, if our hearts and minds are so unreliable, maybe we should be questioning our own intentions and motivations more.

The Dangers of Pure Certainty

(Erin, fan of author, stalked author, was certain that he should be her boyfriend. She's a self-help junkie.)

And yet her values are so fucked that none of this matters. The fact that she does everything "right" doesn’t make her right.

There is a certainty in her that refuses to relinquish itself.

(Roy Baumeister studied "evil". Certainty, not self-doubt, contributed highly. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-purpose/202106/what-actually-is-evil-and-what-makes-people-carry-out-evil-acts )

Some of the worst criminals felt pretty damn good about themselves. And it was this feeling good about themselves in spite of the reality around them that gave them the sense of justification for hurting and disrespecting others.

Milgram Experiments ... researchers told "normal" people that they were to punish other volunteers for breaking various rules.

The problem here is that not only is certainty unattainable, but the pursuit of certainty often breeds more (and worse) insecurity.

**It’s the backwards law again: the more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel.**

But the converse is true as well: the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know.

Uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth.

(to improve)
we must first become uncertain of our current values.

Manson’s Law of Avoidance
**The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.**

Manson’s law applies to both good and bad things in life. Making a million dollars could threaten your identity just as much as losing all your money; becoming a famous rock star could threaten your identity just as much as losing your job. This is why people are often so afraid of success—for the exact same reason they’re afraid of failure: it threatens who they believe themselves to be.

...the real potential of becoming An Artist Nobody Likes was far, far scarier than remaining An Artist Nobody’s Heard Of.

I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.

Kill Yourself
Buddhism argues that your idea of who "you" are is an arbitrary mental construction and that you should let go of the idea that "you" exist at all; that the arbitrary metrics by which you define yourself actually trap you, and thus you’re better off letting go of everything. In a sense, you could say that Buddhism encourages you to not give a fuck.

I have both some good news and some bad news for you: **there is little that is unique or special about your problems.** That’s why letting go is so liberating.

"I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special."

This is narcissism ... You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently

giving up some grandiose ideas about yourself: that you’re uniquely intelligent, or spectacularly talented, or intimidatingly attractive, or especially victimized in ways other people could never imagine. This means giving up your sense of entitlement and your belief that you’re somehow owed something by this world. This means giving up the supply of emotional highs that you’ve been sustaining yourself on for years.

How to Be a Little Less Certain of Yourself

**Ask yourself these questions:**

1: What if I’m wrong?
- (allowing the idea that your opinion or behavior is wrong)

2: What would it mean if I were wrong?
- As for my friend’s brother, his question to himself should be, "What would it mean if I were wrong about my sister’s wedding?

3: Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?
- (It might be harder to accept that you're wrong and your values are messed up, but it creates less drama)
- That’s simply reality: if it feels like it’s you versus the world, chances are it’s really just you versus yourself.

## 7 - Failure Is the Way Forward

(Author graduated around the time of the 2008 recession. Couldn't get a job. Led him to start his own business b/c he had nothing to lose.)

I asked myself a simple question: "Would I rather make decent money and work a job I hated, or play at Internet entrepreneur and be broke for a while?"

(metric for success:)
to not pursue my own projects became the failure

The Failure/Success Paradox

**Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures**\

Avoiding failure is something we learn at some later point in life.
- from school, overbearing parents, the media

(build failure into your goals, like getting better socially)

Better values, as we saw, are process-oriented. Something like "Express myself honestly to others," a metric for the value "honesty," is never completely finished; it’s a problem that must continuously be reengaged.

The reason for Picasso’s success is exactly the same reason why, as an old man, he was happy to scribble drawings on a napkin alone in a café. His underlying value was simple and humble. And it was endless. It was the value "honest expression." And this is what made that napkin so valuable.

Pain Is Part of the Process

In the 1950s, a Polish psychologist named Kazimierz Dabrowski studied World War II survivors and how they’d coped with traumatic experiences in the war.

(some survivors believed that they were _happier_ b/c of the terrible traumas they went through.)
they felt more confident, more sure of themselves, more grateful, and unfazed by life’s trivialities and petty annoyances.

Dabrowski argued that fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily always undesirable or unhelpful states of mind; rather, they are often representative of the necessary pain of psychological growth. And to deny that pain is to deny our own potential. **Just as one must suffer physical pain to build stronger bone and muscle, one must suffer emotional pain to develop greater emotional resilience, a stronger sense of self, increased compassion, and a generally happier life.**

Because if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain, if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking, if you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities, then you’ll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change.

(VCR anecdote - as a kid, author learned how to program the VCR by hitting all the buttons to see what they did. People are amazed by these kinds of acquired skills. They ask "but how?")
These are VCR questions. From the outside, the answer is simple: just shut up and do it.
But from the inside, from the perspective of each of these people, these questions feel impossibly complex and opaque...

And thus, my VCR question: "How do you just walk up and talk to a person?"

(It can be painful, but growth comes out of acting despite pain.)

The "Do Something" Principle

When I was in high school, my math teacher Mr. Packwood used to say, "If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head."

**Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.**

Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it.
- Emotional inspiration → Motivation → Desirable action

The thing about motivation is that it’s not only a three-part chain, but an endless loop:
- Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Etc.

Action → Inspiration → Motivation

(For novelists:)
"Two hundred crappy words per day, that’s it."

(Link: habits/behaviors trump goals)

Recognize that you’ve been an entitled prick in all of your relationships and want to start developing more compassion for others? Do something. Start simple. Make it a goal to listen to someone’s problem and give some of your time to helping that person.

## 8 - The Importance of Saying No

(Author being a digital nomad, much of the "freedom" he craved really boiled down to commitment issues.)

Freedom grants the opportunity for greater meaning, but by itself there is nothing necessarily meaningful about it. (it's a _means to an end_.)

(Russian bluntness / frankness:)
freedom: the ability to say whatever I thought or felt, without fear of repercussion.

... Russian society found the most valuable currency to be trust. And to build trust you have to be honest. That means when things suck, you say so openly and without apology.

(In the west - being "fake" is valued)
The economic system promotes such deception.

Rejection Makes Your Life Better

(Our culture touts "positivity" and "acceptance" to be high values) But we need to reject something. Otherwise, we stand for nothing.

The avoidance of rejection (both giving and receiving it) is often sold to us as a way to make ourselves feel better. But avoiding rejection gives us short-term pleasure by making us rudderless and directionless in the long term.

we all must give a fuck about something, in order to value something. And **to value something, we must reject what is not that something. To value X, we must reject non-X.**

Entitled people, because they feel as though they deserve to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad.

Boundaries

Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet not to celebrate romance, but rather to satirize it...

there are healthy forms of love and unhealthy forms of love. Unhealthy love is based on two people trying to escape their problems through their emotions for each other—in other words, they’re using each other as an escape. Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support.

The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner.

In general, entitled people fall into one of two traps in their relationships. Either they expect other people to take responsibility for their problems ... Or they take on too much responsibility for other people’s problems ...

These are the yin and yang of any toxic relationship: the victim and the saver, the person who starts fires because it makes her feel important and the person who puts out fires because it makes him feel important. (these two types are typically drawn to each other...a type of "chemistry")

It can be difficult for people to recognize the difference between doing something out of obligation and doing it voluntarily. So **here’s a litmus test: ask yourself, "If I refused, how would the relationship change?" Similarly, ask, "If my partner refused something I wanted, how would the relationship change?"**

it’s about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That’s unconditional love, baby.

How to Build Trust

(Author will be honest with his wife - if she doesn't look "amazing" after a lot of time spent getting ready, he'll tell her. He appreciates that kind of honesty from her as well. Conflict, telling something they don't want to hear is fundamental to building trust.)

Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship, for the simple reason that **without trust, the relationship doesn’t actually mean anything.** A person could tell you that she loves you ... You don’t feel loved until you trust that the love being expressed toward you comes without any special conditions or baggage attached to it.

(on cheating)
What needs to happen is that cheaters have to start peeling away at their self-awareness onion and figure out what fucked-up values caused them to break the trust of the relationship (and whether they actually still value the relationship). They need to be able to say, "You know what: I am selfish.

When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. Without the first step, there should be no attempt at reconciliation in the first place.

Freedom Through Commitment

paradox of choice ... the more options we’re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose, because we’re aware of all the other options we’re potentially forfeiting.

**pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to experience the rewards of depth of experience.**

Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. Commitment gives you freedom because it hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. Commitment makes decision-making easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you ever stress about chasing more, more, more again? Commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would.

## 9 - And Then You Die

(Author's friend drowned, left him depressed, feeling like life is meaningless)

I came to the startling realization that if there really is no reason to do anything, then there is also no reason to not do anything; that in the face of the inevitability of death, there is no reason to ever give in to one’s fear or embarrassment or shame, since it’s all just a bunch of nothing anyway; and that by spending the majority of my short life avoiding what was painful and uncomfortable, I had essentially been avoiding being alive at all.

perhaps the worst moment of my life was also the most transformational.

death is the light by which the shadow of all of life’s meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero.

Something Beyond Our Selves

Ernest Becker - philosopher

The Denial of Death essentially makes two points:
- 1 - "death terror," a deep existential anxiety that underlies everything we think or do.
- 2 -  in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever.

Becker called such efforts our **"immortality projects,"** projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death. All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of immortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and authorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and women who came before us. ... all the meaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die.

**our immortality projects are our values.** They are the barometers of meaning and worth in our life. And when our values fail, so do we, psychologically speaking.

giving a fuck about something is the only thing that distracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death.

Becker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed: that **people’s immortality projects were actually the problem, not the solution;** that rather than attempting to implement, often through lethal force, their conceptual self across the world, people should question their conceptual self and become more comfortable with the reality of their own death. Becker called this "the bitter antidote," and struggled with reconciling it himself as he stared down his own demise. While death is bad, it is inevitable. Therefore, we should not avoid this realization, but rather come to terms with it as best we can. Because once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death—the root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions—we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views.

The Sunny Side of Death

South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope (trying to get as close to the edge as possible to directly feel the potent fear of death)

This willing and even exuberant interfacing with one’s own mortality has ancient roots. The Stoics ... (**memento mori**)

**the practice of meditation is often taught as a means of preparing oneself for death while still remaining alive.** Dissolving one’s ego into an expansive nothingness—achieving the enlightened state of nirvana—is seen as a trial run of letting oneself cross to the other side.

**Death is the only thing we can know with any certainty.** And as such, it must be the compass by which we orient all of our other values and decisions.

believing that you are a contributing component in some much larger entity, that your life is but a mere side process of some great unintelligible production.

(entitlement)
It’s these dynamics that plague us now. We are so materially well off, yet so psychologically tormented in so many low-level and shallow ways.
