## Summary

Wheel of Life - method 1

rate each of these 9 sections out of 10

- work category:
  - Mission
  - money
  - growth
- health category:
  - body
  - mind
  - soul
- relationships category:
  - romance
  - family
  - friends

Overall:
- Joy - how aligned do you feel with your actions in the hero now compared to where you want to be in terms of the amount of joy you are experiencing in your life?

it is worth highlighting or underlining or circling or whatever in each of these different areas in work and health and relationships what is the one that really stands out to you as needing some amount of work?

12 Month celebration - method 2

in each of the Salient areas of your life ask yourself what would I like to be celebrating 12 months from now?

"I would like to be celebrating all these five 10 different different things but if I had to boil it down to just one thing and I could only celebrate one thing what would that one thing be?"

whenever you set a goal just add a few words to the end of that goal which is "while enjoying every step along the way"

please write this down somewhere

and this is why things like weekly reviews and monthly reviews and quarterly reviews and all this sort of stuff like reviewing our life is such a big part of anyone's productivity system at least if they know anything about productivity

and then the final tip I would recommend for the 12 month month celebration is bit of an optional extra but this is quite helpful - when you've decided what you'd like to be celebrating 12 months from now with each of these different areas: ask yourself why? why is that particular thing important to you?

and it's useful to have the why also in that document where you have written down your goals because again you can just remind yourself about why this thing was important to you

Ideal Week calendar - method 3

you open up a blank Google Calendar, and you call it your ideal Week calendar

and you start off by blocking off the absolute Essentials in your life in terms of like when do you want to wake up

when doing the ideal week is we want to try and find time or not try we want to find time in our calendar every week to actually make time and to to take action on these specific things

if you realize that you don't actually have time for a particular thing because you're busy with other areas of your life, that's totally okay but that means you can change your goal, you can change the 12 month celebration to reflect the time that you actually have.

hey friends welcome back to the channel.
so what does it mean to make a given
year the best year of your life?

three things.

- we are making progress towards the things that truly matter to us
- our life is broadly in Balance so we're not screwing up one area of our life for the sake of another
- we are while working towards the things that matter to us we are managing to enjoy ourselves and kind of enjoying every day on its own Merit rather than purely seeing it as a means to an end

and so in this video I want to
go over three of my favorite methods

these are really simple methods you can apply them whenever, whether it's at the start of the year or the middle of the year or the end of the year like literally whenever

and it will help you move more towards making sure that this coming year is the actual best year of your life in terms of meaningfulness and balance and enjoyability as well

## Wheel of Life - method 1

the idea here is that we want to split up life into a bunch of different components and then we rate our satisfaction with those different areas of life

so if you want to do this exercise you can do it on a piece
of paper or you can do it on your phone
I think a piece of paper is nice

start by drawing a little circle that is your wheel and then you want to split it up into three segments and those three segments are for

- work
- health
- relationships

so now you have a wheel with 3/3 now you want to split up each of the thirds into three segments each so at this point you've got a wheel with nine segments

if you don't want to do it on paper you don't have to it on paper you can just literally write down these different categories that I'm about to give you

and so those categories are within Health we have
- body
- mind
- soul

or you can call it physical health, mental health, spiritual health

under relationships
- romance
- family
- friends

under work
- Mission
- money
- growth

and you can call Mission your career or job or whatever you want to call it

okay so at this point we've split up life into these nine different components and the job now is that we want to rate on a scale from 0 to 10 how aligned we feel in each of these different areas of our life

and by aligned I mean my actions in the here and now are consistent with where I think I would like to be

you can sort of think of this as how satisfied am I with this area of life

I prefer to think of it as alignment rather than satisfaction because like I don't know you might be a three out of 10 in terms of satisfaction with money because you're not yet a I don't know millionaire in passive income or whatever the thing might be but you might be a 10 out of 10 in alignment because you are taking the actions necessary to get to where you want to be

and so with this little diagram on screen I would encourage you to pause the video now genuinely please pause the video and just think about what would your rating out of 10 be for each of these different areas of life

and I guarantee that you will come up with with some interesting insights into your life and this is genuinely a good use of your time

now these are the ratings that I gave myself when I did this exercise a few days ago and the cool thing is is that if you are doing this on pen and paper then you can shade in the Little Wheel of life based on what your numbers are so if you got a 10 out of 10 you would fully shade in that particular segment of the wheel if you got a five you would half shade it in you get the idea

and you end up with this sort of FIFA esque radar chart of like these different aspects of your life which I think is pretty cool

now once you've done that we're going to add one one final category which I don't put as part of the wheel I sort of put it off to the side or underneath the wheel if I'm doing it on pen and paper and that is the category for **Joy - how aligned do you feel with your actions in the hero now compared to where you want to be in terms of the amount of joy you are experiencing in your life?**

and for me right now that is probably a six out of 10

now this is great because the whole point is to help make this next year the best year of our life

and so in theory if we were able to get to a point where we were let's say 10 out of 10 across all these different areas that would mean that we are doing the things that are most meaningful to us and actually making progress towards them and we're also in balance with all the different areas of our life because broadly these 10 roughly cover pretty much every area of life

and hopefully we are also enjoying the journey along the way especially if we have a 10 out of 10 on the joy front too

so this is pretty cool right it means we have now created a clear sense of where we are right now

## Goals

and then we can get a sense of where we would like to be in terms of where we would like these numbers to go

and whenever you have a sense of where you are now and where you want to be that is what creates what we call goals

and part of making this year the best year of your life is to be able to then make progress towards those goals and this is already a really good start because a lot of people want to be more productive but they don't even take an inventory of their life because they just think of productivity as being just about work or just about hustle or grind or whatever

but actually at least the way I think about it productivity is using our time in a way that's intentional and effective and enjoyable and that is kind of the message of my book feel good productivity

at this point **it is worth highlighting or underlining or circling or whatever in each of these different areas in work and health and relationships what is the one that really stands out to you as needing some amount of work?**

so for example for me in the relationships column I've given my friends category a four out of 10 because I just don't see my friends very often

and so that's one that clearly for me needs some work and so I'd be cycling that

within Health I've given my soul category of 4 out of 10 but I mean I'm not overly concerned about that

I am concerned about the body/ physical health being just a 5 out of 10 so I'm going to circle that because that's something I want to actively work on

and then on the work front I'm pretty blessed to be a 9 out of 10 on Mission and money but I'm only a 7 out of 10 for growth and so I want to Circle that one because I feel like I could do with some more growth in my life

but once you know how to do The Wheel of Life you can actually just do this whenever you you feel like your life is somewhat misaligned or you're not really sure where you're going or you feel a bit burnt out you feel a bit stressed

it literally takes 30 seconds to just bring up these different 9 to 10 categories and to just rate yourself out of 10 on each one

and that's not to beat yourself up you're not like oh my God I'm flagala myself because I only gave myself a three out of 10, this is a pure solid inventory of where you are in these different areas of life

and then the great news is you can then start taking actions towards remedying certain of these areas

now if you've been wondering why my money component on this Wheel of Life is a 9 out of 10 that is because a I've been running my business over for over 7 years now and B I have been investing my money throughout that time

## 12 Month celebration - method 2

this is basically my preferred method for goal setting

so setting goals is an important part of life. there's a bunch of studies that show that people who set goals perform better and are more productive and feel happier with life than people who don't.  there are also a bunch of studies that show that people who write their goals down are more likely to achieve them than people who either have the goals and don't write them down or don't have the goals at all

and so the 12month celebration is just a very simple way of approaching goal setting

and the exercise is simple

**in each of the Salient areas of your life ask yourself what would I like to be celebrating 12 months from now?**

and really imagine this like imagine you sitting down having dinner with a friend of yours you guys are mutually kind of holding each other accountable and helping each other out and you're celebrating together you're really celebrating how much progress you've made in each of these different areas of your life

now you can start with the three areas that you circled as being the most Salient or you can do it as as I would recommend for all 10 different areas of your life

especially if you're doing this like at the start of the year as part of an annual planning thing

you're asking yourself 12 months from now in each of these different areas what what would I like to be celebrating?

so for example for me in the physical health category because I've realized I've only rated it at 5 out of 10 I'm imagining I'm having dinner with let's say my friend Godwin who's pretty pretty jacked and we're celebrating how much progress I've made in the last 12 months in my physical health - what is like genuinely what is the thing that I would love to be celebrating 12 months from now?

and then I'll come up with a few different candidate celebration options like you know a few a few different options for goals

so I'd love to be celebrating having packed on loads of muscle I'd love to be celebrating getting more lean I'd love to be celebrating having consistently worked out let's say three times a week for the last 12 months, I'd love to be celebrating becoming more flexible in Mobile, I'd love to be celebrating having played Sports once or twice a week every week for the last 12 months

so these are
all different options, but celebrating
all of these is probably a bit much. and
so for each of these different
categories once you've thought about
like what would I love to be celebrating,
what I'd encourage you to do is to
really boil it down.

"**I would like to be celebrating all these five 10 different different things but if I had to boil it down to just one thing and I could only celebrate one thing what would that one thing be?**"

because
generally having a single goal to work
towards helps the brain focus it helps
the entire kind of physiology and our
habits and everything just move in that
One Direction

whereas if I was trying to
build more muscle and also get lean and
also play sports and also be more
flexible it's like there's a lot of it
it becomes very overwhelming and very
complicated very quickly and I'm all
about Simplicity here, so starting with
what is the one goal what is the one
thing you would like to be celebrating

and so for me in the physical health
front I realized that the one thing I
would love to be celebrating is to
reduce the amount of my
visceral abdominal fat

I have done
a couple of Dexter scans recently I
found that I've got quite a lot of fat
around the belly thanks to my poor
genetics and poor diet and visceral
adapost tissue is the thing that
correlates with all these negative
Health outcomes like cardiovascular
disease and stroke and all the bad stuff
and so if I can get that number down, if
I can reduce the amount of fat in my
belly thanks to my poor diet and my poor
genetics and that would be a great thing
worth celebrating

and then all the other
stuff like getting more muscle and
becoming more mobile and like playing
sports all of that kind of stuff is the
cherry on top it's the bonus

and so you
can do this 12 month celebration thing
with the different areas of your life
and that then creates goals

now a couple of extra points when it comes to the 12 month Celebration: one line that I really like adding to the end of any goal that I set it's actually a trick I got from my friend dicki Bush who is a fellow internet entrepreneur, and that is **whenever you set a goal just add a few words to the end of that goal which is "while enjoying every step along the way"**

so if we use this health example again
you know my well month celebration is to
reduce my visceral adpost issues to I.E
become more lean, but I would add the
phrase "while enjoying every step along
the way"

and that means that instead of
just thinking of it as this goal that
I'm fixated on that I'm going to kind of
grind to get towards it just helps my
mind think in a little bit more of a
light Feelgood productivity kind of way
a little bit more of an adventurous way
of like how do I get lean but while also
enjoying every step along the way

and then tip number two for the 12 month celebration is: **please write this down somewhere**

so I have a Google doc that I
use with my CEO coach his name is Eric
and we look at the Google Doc every
every quarter and we've written down
what are my goals for each of the
different areas of my life

and then
every quarter every 3 months we'll
figure out okay cool for each of these
different areas what can what can we
make tangible progress on in the next 90
days

and this is super helpful because
if you think about these goals and you
make them in your mind but you don't
write them down and then you don't look
at that document ever again then it just
means you're going to forget what goals
you set at the start of the year

and
this is a big part of why people
struggle with New Year's resolutions

because
they set all these goals they have all
these like great intentions but then
they don't have any sort of system for
reviewing the go goals, reflecting on it,
measuring their action and measuring
their traction towards that particular
goal

and so if you're doing this
exercise and I'd really recommend you do
if you do care about making this year
the best year of your life write the
goal down somewhere, put it in a Google
doc, bookmark it put it on your chrome
bookmark bar, whatever the thing might be

just make it super easy to remind
yourself about what your goals are

**and this is why things like weekly reviews and monthly reviews and quarterly reviews and all this sort of stuff like reviewing our life is such a big part of anyone's productivity system** at least if they know anything about productivity

and then the final tip I would recommend for the 12 month month celebration is bit of an optional extra but this is quite helpful - **when you've decided what you'd like to be celebrating 12 months from now with each of these different areas: ask yourself why? why is that particular thing important to you?**

**and it's useful to have the why also in that document where you have written down your goals because again you can just remind yourself about why this thing was important to you**\

and so for me the why
behind this visceral adapost thing is
and this is what I've written down in my
document "because visceral adapost issue
is the major thing that's going to lead
to me dying early of cardiovascular and
cerebral vascular disease. it's a
significant priority to get that number
down and to keep it down building more
muscle is mostly a vanity thing but
reducing my abdominal fat is genuinely a
health thing"

so I've written down for
myself exactly why that particular goal
is important to me

and that's not to say
you can't change these goals later in
the year

but at least if you have it
written down and you have a clear why
behind it it means that you're more
likely to stay on that path that you
decided for yourself was going to be
important

## Ideal Week calendar - method 3

we come to Method number three
and this is where the rubber meets the
road like you know with the reflection
and goal setting and stuff we have kind
of charted a course for where we want to
go and now we need a system to ensure
that we we actually make the time and
the space to get there

and now there's
loads of different productivity systems
for this I have a whole course that's
coming out soon that's going to be about
my field good productivity system you
can read about strategies in the book as
well, but one really needle moving
strategy I want to share in this video
is something that's called the ideal
week method

and this has been one of the
most game-changing time management
techniques I've ever used

and basically the idea is that **you open up a blank Google Calendar, and you call it your ideal Week calendar**

and **you start off by blocking off the absolute Essentials in your life in terms of like when do you want to wake up**

so for example let's say every day I want to wake up at 7:00 a.m. I would put that into a block in the calendar

let's say I want to sleep at
10: p.m. I'd put that into a block in
the calendar

I'd be putting all these
different blocks into my calendar

and
then that shows me how much time do I
have left to play with

so now you know those goals that we've just set in terms of the 12- month celebration in terms of these different areas of our life our job, **when doing the ideal week is we want to try and find time or not try we want to find time in our calendar every week to actually make time and to to take action on these specific things**

so let's
say in the friends category I wanted to
see my friends more often, my 12 months
celebration might be that I'm
celebrating the fact that I saw my
friends for a group dinner at least once
a week

in my ideal Week calendar I
therefore need to have a block at least
once a week for a group dinner with
friends

and that's the point of the
ideal week it's like your ideal ordinary
week

it's you know if things are going
according to plan roughly where are you
spending your time and what are you
blocking out time to do

similarly on the
health front my 12- month celebration is
losing is becoming more lean, and that
means I need to have half an hour of day
blocked into my ideal week for exercise
every morning or every evening or
whatever the thing might be

and **if you realize that you don't actually have time for a particular thing because you're busy with other areas of your life, that's totally okay but that means you can change your goal, you can change the 12 month celebration to reflect the time that you actually have.**

one of the
other big things that derails people is
trying to be too perfectionistic and
trying to do too much

trying to say Hey
you know I want to set this goal and
this goal and this goal and this goal
and then you look at your calendar and
you realize you actually just physically
don't have the time because you have a
job or two or you have kids to look
after or you have to commute to school
or whatever the thing might be

the thing
I love about the ideal week method is
that it forces us to get clarity on what
what is actually important to us

what is
the time that we have for the things
that we have to do and then what's the
time that we can use on the things that
we actually want to do

and mostly you'll
probably realize that this is less time
than you thought you had which is great
because it means you can start doing
fewer things and you can cross some
things off your 12mth celebration list

maybe it's not a goal you want to work
on for this year that's totally okay

maybe you can work on it next year
instead or when you have a little bit
more time freed up in your life
