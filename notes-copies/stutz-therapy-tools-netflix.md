## Life Force

You don't need to know your "life purpose". You can work on your life force at any time, it'll help you feel better immediately.

Pyramid:

```
- (Top) Yourself - journaling
- (Middle) People - any relationship represents all relationships
- (Base) Body - sleep, exercise, nutrition
```

## Part X

- The voice of impossibility, ego and self protection
- It never goes away

```
A stick figure person surrounded by Xs (these are "No")
```

Three unchanging aspects of reality:
- pain
- uncertainty
- constant work

We need this negativity to move us forward. Our life's work/goal is to overcome challenges.

When adversity goes up, opportunity goes up

## Tools

Tools give us a way to overcome the challenges of reality

> So what are the Tools? Conceptually, Stutz describes each of them as a simple step, an action or a bit of forward motion. They can change your inner state almost immediately, according to Stutz, taking unpleasant experiences and thoughts and transforming them into opportunities. Stutz says his Tools “turn problems [in]to possibilities,” and give people the propulsive feeling that they can make big changes. In practice, the Tools are visualization exercises. In Stutz, each Tool is accompanied by cards with hand-drawn illustrations that, according to Stutz, render even the biggest, most complicated concepts into something manageable. 

## String of pearls

Every action is a pearl, the strings attach these actions.

> You are the only person who can put the next pearl on the string.

As long as you move forward, that's what counts, especially in the face of uncertainty

Every action has equal weight - getting out of bed is equal to a big achievement.

Every pearl has a turd in it. Turds represent imperfections, every action has imperfections. Your job is to not be concerned with that and just move forward.

## The shadow

Inferior, embarrassed, rejected, despondent part of yourself.

Tool: Imagine that you're talking to this part of yourself. Ask how you've treated it, see what it says. The shadow needs your love and attention, not the world's attention. The more you accept your shadow, the more  tolerant you are of whatever life throws at you (especially others' judgments)

> Think of Part X as your doubts and deepest fears, and the Shadow as the by-product of believing whatever Part X tells you. 

## The Snapshot

The realm of illusion. Persona. Driven by Part X

This image of "perfection" you hold onto is denial of three realities, it's static and has no depth
When you achieve according to the snapshot, you realize that this doesn't cure you

## The maze

Being trapped in the past, fixated on external blame, wanting to be "paid back" for what was done to you.

**Active love** is the antidote. Imagine the universe is filled with love, inhale all of it, concentrate all your love on a person you blame. Being one with the person you hate is a superpower - if you can love them, you can love yourself

## Radical acceptance

"Squeezing the juice" - Getting something positive out of the negative event

## The grateful flow

What you see you as a matter of what you're looking at.

```
Your view of the sun is blocked by clouds. But the sun is always there!
```

Think of 3 to 4 small things to be grateful for. Before you think of another specific thing, block the thought and just feel the flow of gratitude. Stay in that state is long as you can, often as possible

## Loss processing

Potency of nonattachment.

We tend to be bad at loss and create pain anticipating it

We can practice the act of willing ourselves not to have something we are attached to. We can still pursue it, just be a little less attached.

Tool:
- imagine you're holding on to the branch of a tree
- say "I'm willing to lose everything."
- imagine that you fall into the sun and burn up. Now you are a ray of light. Suns are everywhere, you are pure giving.

The sun world is the true world.

With loss comes death, but death leads to rebirth.
