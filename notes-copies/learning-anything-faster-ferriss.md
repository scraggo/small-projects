Just about everything you need to know about meta-learning can be understood — or at least observed — by watching these two videos. (Michael Phelps vs. Shinji Takeuchi) [12:06]

- [The Most Graceful Freestyle Swimming by Shinji Takeuchi](https://youtu.be/rJpFVvho0o4)

Using the DiSSS (deconstruction, selection, sequencing, and stakes) process to drastically shorten the time it took to learn languages. [25:04]

- Deconstruction: What are the minimal learnable units with which you should start? [27:50]
- Selection: Which 20 percent of the blocks should I focus on for 80 percent or more of the outcomes I want?
- Sequencing: In what order should you learn the blocks? [28:14]
- Stakes: How do you set up stakes to create real consequences and guarantee you follow the program? [28:19]

The secondary principles of CaFE (compression, frequency, encoding). [28:32]

- Compression: Can you encapsulate the most important 20 percent into an easily graspable one-pager? [28:51]
- Frequency: How frequently should you practice? What is the minimum effective dose (MED) for volume? [29:00]
- Encoding: How do you anchor the new material to what you already know for rapid recall?  [29:13]

Here is Ferriss’ approach to learning anything more quickly and more deeply:

- **Deconstruction**: “This is taking a skill and breaking it into the smallest lego pieces possible,” Ferris says.
- **Selection**: “Selection in effect uses the [80/20 principle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/03/07/80-20-rule/#6cfec5ca3814) of Pareto’s law to answer the question, ‘what 20% of those lego blocks deliver 80% of the results?’ The effects here can be profound.”
- **Sequencing**: “Sequencing is the most neglected, perhaps. What is a logical progression in which to lay out the lego blocks I’ve selected—those 20%?”
- **Stakes**: “How do you build in incentives and motivations—whether that’s a reward or punishment, or both—so that you or other people will actually do what the plans include?”
