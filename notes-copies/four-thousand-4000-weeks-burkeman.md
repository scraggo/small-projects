- The book Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman
- Life is very short. You can't do everything. So it makes sense to give up that struggle and focus instead.
- This is false: if I got the right system or the right approach to task management or organizing my stuff or scheduling my day, that I'd finally break through to this feeling of being in perfect control of time.
- productivity geekery doesn't work, it makes things worse
- you can be ambitious, but never actually work on all the things you can freely decide upon
- cultures used to have "task orientation" - this is instead of seeing time as a separate bucket that we can fill
- we encode memory of duration through the amount of new information that's coming in. And so childhood is full of novel experiences, and if you're too routinised in your adult life it really aids that bad sense of time whizzing by because there's not enough new information coming in.
- Advice: Do one thing at a time.
- A friend of mine, the meditation teacher Susan Piver, says that busy-ness is a form of laziness, which really speaks to your point there that it’s the comfortable option, in many ways, to feel like you're darting among all these projects instead of holding yourself to one of them for awhile.

## Introduction

Time management should be more about how our lives are short, not about how to get more done

We tend to take on more when we become more efficient. It makes us anxious and distracted

"Mind like water" is the promise of GTD. But the deeper implication is that there'll always be an overwhelming amount of things to do

\* **What we should value: nice days, our families, what we care about most**

## Part 1 choosing to choose

## Ch 1 The limit-embracing life

Medieval times: task-oriented, not time oriented. In modern times we're hardly aware that we view **time as an entity that we "fill", and that employers have access to an amount of it**

By 1790, an employer may be upset that he's not getting efficient usage of time from an employee, getting mad at them for loitering, singing, smoking, etc

\* We should consider if things are worth doing in the first place. That's more important than trying to simply get more things done

\* We start to see time usage as a means to a future end. We forget how to enjoy the current moment.

In trying to master time, time masters you.

Productivity geekery. **It's an impossible task to stay on top of everything no matter how good your system is**

\* The systems help us avoid asking the hard questions that make us anxious. Should we marry? Is this what I want to do with my life?

Mindset changes: don't beat yourself up - no one manages time well. To be perfect is to be a god. Humans aren't that, we should embrace our limitations
It's not just a mindset shift - there are real external demands on us

## Ch 2 the efficiency trap

Many of us feel like we aren't fitting everything we want into our lives. As a result, we hope to solve the problem by doing things more efficiently so we can get more done.

Irony: the better you get at doing tasks, the more tasks you tend to do. It's Sisyphus boulder

No afterlife means we have to fulfill ourselves during life. We feel stress about that
Progress gives us high standards

\* Even trying to live a life of maximizing pleasure, and there's FOMO
Facebook, dating sites, email, increase the size of everything and we feel like we're missing out on more

Clearing the decks:
More things to do = doing less meaningful stuff. Less chance you'll evaluate the importance of the tasks

**We inevitably never "clear the decks" for the big meaningful tasks.** Cranking through the small tasks never ends

Don't be reactive. **Tolerate the anxiety and discomfort of leaving things undone**

Instead of FOMO: enjoy the events that are actually happening now

**Convenience industry. Getting rid of a tedious task. Uber, Apple Wallet, food delivery. But we lose some value by "solving" that problem.** One, those little interactions are important for community-building. Two, friction allows the consumer to reevaluate. It's the thought that counts - actually, **it's the effort that counts.** We stop doing what we prefer. Things seem more annoying. Anecdote: someone gives up their frantic professional life. Moves to a house where they light a fire every day, tend to the cows, hands on with their children. An inconvenient, but more fulfilling life for them.

## Ch 3 Facing Finitude

Heidegger
Embracing that we're Beings Toward Death is the only authentic way to exist. The other ways are denial

\* Being finite is the ultimate constraint of life. We're all constrained by this!

\* Thinking that "4000 weeks is small compared to infinity" is being entitled. Thinking that our short lives are vast compared to not existing at all is being grateful.

\* JOMO - the joy of missing out

## Ch 4 becoming a better procrastinator

How to choose what not to do. Procrastination is the in between of not doing something and doing it. **Neglecting the right things is the real key to time management.**

1\. pay yourself first
Like automatically saving part of your paycheck, we should do what's most important to us first. We'll never get through the little tasks and have room for the big ones later.
- eat the frog (but your thing)
- Schedule time with yourself (early in the day and regularly)

2\. limit works in progress
Try 3 as upper limit. Everything else waits in a queue for a slot to open

3\. resist middling priorities
Warren Buffet's 25/5 rule. The 20 things you don't choose you have to actively avoid

We procrastinate on doing the important things because:
- We fear doing them imperfectly
- We fear giving up something. Especially committing in relationships. We prefer to be indecisive, holding onto the imagined futures instead of living one of them

Settling. We can't do anything but! No one is perfect, continuing to seek perfection is settling for a restless, lonely life. When we become disenchanted, it's because we realize the other person is finite.

We often want contradictory qualities in a person. So when they don't have one or the other, we should blame ourselves for wanting the impossible/unlikely

It's more satisfying to commit

## Ch 5 the watermelon problem

In 2016, many were distracted by a video of rubber bands being added to a watermelon until it burst.

Attention is the central problem of our finitude. Our lives are what we pay attention to. Being distracted is paying with your life.

Being distract-able is a necessary survival attribute. "Involuntary attention" is this "bottom up" attention that allows us to notice the unexpected.

\* "Top down" attention is choice of what to focus on. Man's Search for Meaning, finding meaning in a concentration camp, for example

Online distractions encourage compulsive behavior, much like slot machine usage. They create a distorted view of the world, reshaping what we think is important
Reality is less compelling after being captivated by perfectly engineered digital experiences.

The blame not only lies with Silicon Valley and politicians - it lies with ourselves. **We want to be distracted, to not focus on the hard problem of creating life's meaning and acting on it**

## Ch 6 the intimate interruptor

Monk training - man forced by his zen master to put icy water on his body. When he resisted sensing the pain by distracting himself, it made it worse. When he was fully mindful of his present experience, it became bearable.

\* Often when we reach for something to distract ourselves with, we're doing so because we refuse to tolerate the pain we're in at the moment.

\* the intimate interruptor is our tendency to allow ourselves to be distracted, even while doing what we want to do. It requiring concentration puts us in touch with our finitude. Boredom is this discomfort

The internet makes us feel infinite, instant, unconstrained

Digital detoxes don't address the urge for this distraction.

\* Coming to terms with this fact is the cure, in a way. To be able to focus, we need to be accepting. We can't be attached to an idea of willpower helping us focus without distraction

\* (I'm attached to an idea of childlike creativity, fully engaged in what I do, undistractable)

## Part 2, Beyond control

## Ch 7 we never really have time

Hofstadter's law - tasks always take longer than you expect

> Hofstadter's law is a self-referential adage, coined by Douglas Hofstadter in his book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (1979) to describe the widely experienced difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity: Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

**Planning is a way to get reassurance from the future. But the future can never provide it.** anxiety is fueled by this, we worry repeatedly looking for comfort. (the worry itself is a way to comfort ourselves? At least I worried a ton about it!)

we never really have time: time is more of a statistical phenomenon. It's not a commodity we have - we can only predict based on our current investments in the future. We can _prefer_ outcomes, not _guarantee_ them.

A countless number of random, happenstance events that we had no control of created today's circumstances. We don't have control of much!
That's why we should mindful of only the moment.

Krishnamurti: "I don't mind what happens." We can't ever demand  certainty. Surrender.

## Ch 8 You are here

\* We see time as a means to a future end. As if value can only be created in the future. "When I finally..." is the future fixated mindset.

Child rearing advice all seems to think settling the child up for future psychological benefits is the most important thing. But what about what's most enjoyable to the parent and child in the moment?

"The causal catastrophe" - the loss of childhood due to the above mentality
"A child's purpose is to be a child."

There will be a last time you do everything. This moment is unique and you only have so many left

\* Capitalism "instrumentalizes" everything. Earth, humans, time, are all resources to be utilized for future profit. It makes us miserable, even the successful

Being fixated on living in the moment usually ruins the experience. You try too hard to do something you're already doing - which is living in the moment - and that attempt separates us from that fact

## Ch 9 Rediscovering rest

More rest makes you a better worker, they say.
Why do we need to justify our leisure and time off?
Do we always need to be getting better in some way?
Leisure becomes work in that case!

\* Aristotle: Leisure is the highest good, granted it's spent in self reflection and philosophical contemplation

Leisure used to be the default state. "Work" was an unfortunate interruption to leisure, its tasks in service of getting back to leisure. (Reminds me of Marx)

When time became a commodity, leisure became restricted because business owners didn't want their employees coming to work with a hangover (for example)

Irony: leisure must be idle for it to be true leisure

\* Workaholism: idleness aversion

The sabbath acknowledges how difficult it is to not work, so it has strict guidelines of what you can't do. Adds a social dimension to leisure

\* Taking a hike in the countryside is an Atelic activity!
Same for Hobbies, not the side hustle type

\* Precisely because you're not good at something is why you should do the hobby. No pressure for results is freedom!

## Ch 10 The impatience spiral

Technology has made things take less time. Instead of having more time, we've become more impatient. Our expectations have changed: instead of seeing increased convenience, we get frustrated that those things have to take any time at all.

\* Impatience is an uncomfortable emotion. We tend to reach for something, distraction, work, alcohol, to quell difficult feelings. Alcoholism and other maladaptive behaviors result - a vicious spiral of needing to stop but being unable to. We shouldn't be trying to quell the emotions anyways

Irony: only by letting go of control (the desire to stop living a fast paced life), can you hope to gain control again. Those addicted to a  fast-paced life should just give up trying to make everything faster.
This is a second order change, a change in perspective. **You can relish in the fact that things take the time they need.**

## Ch 11 Staying on the bus

_Patience_ is a virtue, but we see it as passive and powerless
Better to see it as a powerful wisdom in allowing things to take the time they need

Art instructor gives an assignment: choose a painting in an art gallery. Look at it for 3 hours. Most of us would never give ourselves permission to do such a thing. But a painting becomes more real when you give it that time.

\* Developing more patience:
- 1 - embrace problems, don't run from them
- 2 - embrace radical incrementalism. Work in smaller more regular chunks of time. The radical part is to force yourself to stop after a certain short period
- 3 - originality comes from unoriginality. The "bus" you're on is a creative path you've chosen. Inevitably, it'll be pointed out that you're somewhat of a copy of your influences. Instead of starting over and choosing a new path, "stay on the bus." It gets more exciting and interesting later. This applies to general life too. Don't be afraid of a more conventional path like marriage or living in one place for a long time. With patience, you can find a unique way there too.

## Ch 12 the loneliness of the digital nomad

We think having control of our time and working place - where no one else is able to dictate it - is ideal. But it's not. It's time hoarding. It's not valuable unless we can share it with others, collaborate, build relationships.

\* We enjoy our time off more if others also have time off. We should have more regulation around this - more forced community focused holidays. Fika - the Swedish all stop for break every day.

Humans are hardwired to synchronize with others. It contributes to our well being. When we can't synchronize with others, we get painfully lonely.

Autocrats would take advantage of our lack of ability to synchronize

Not time hoarding is like Surrender (link)

## Ch 13 cosmic insignificance therapy

[[cosmic-insignificance-burkeman]]

## Ch 14 the human disease

Brian Tracy's book: Master your time, master your life
We are time, so we can't master it, can't get outside of it to get a hold of it

Being Zen about the fact that we're finite is the only answer

\* 5 questions:
1. where in your life are you pursuing comfort, when what's required is discomfort? Procrastination, distraction, commitment phobia. Choose enlargement
2. are you holding yourself to impossible standards for productivity, time management, etc? Salvation is never coming!
3. in what ways do you need to accept who you are instead of who you want to be? Are you living with the mentality that you need to get somewhere to finally be happy, some sort of validation, earn your deserving of being on earth? What about enjoying your time?
4. what areas of your life are you holding back due to lack of experience? No one is an expert at anything, so take more risks!
5. how would you spend your days differently if you didn't care about seeing your actions come to fruition? Results are much less important than we think they are. In fact, sometimes activities have no concrete results, like parenting.

\* Jung - there's no right way to live. We pursue integration, wholeness in individual ways. Do the next right thing in any given moment. It's all you can do, it's all you have to do.

## Afterward, beyond hope

How do you act in the face of global catastrophes? We should act with urgency, do the work, instead of pursuing time management etc.

\* Give up hope of feeling in control

Things aren't ok, they'll never be ok.
The apocalypse is already here. Your 4000 weeks are always running out.

Realizing this is liberating. You can appreciate what's here now and that you get to be here.

## Appendix: 10 tools for embracing finitude

- 1. adopt a fixed volume approach to getting things done.
  - Open and closed task lists:
    - Open: inbox that can grow unboundedly.
    - Closed: contains a fixed number of tasks, say 10. You can only add one after you complete one.
  - Fixed working time: Cal Newport - by only allowing work in a fixed time, you're more aware of how much time it'll take
- 2. serialize. Focus on one project at a time. At most, one work project and one non work project. Get used to tolerating the anxiety that results from this focus.
- 3. decide in advance what to fail at. Examples: do the bare minimum at work for 2 months, neglect kitchen duties
- 4. focus on what you've already completed instead of what's left. You don't start with a debt, you have a "done" list
- 5. consolidate your caring. Limit what you give attention to, especially on social media
- 6. embrace boring single purpose technology. Remove social media, go to grayscale
- 7. seek out novelty in the mundane. Time moves faster when we engage in the same habits and routines year after year. Put more attention into your every day life. Take a different route while walking, for example
- 8. be a researcher in relationships. Be curious about the human you're with. See what happens instead of demanding an outcome
  - Book, _Embracing Uncertainty_
- 9. practice spontaneous generosity. Complement right away, donations
- 10. practice doing nothing. If you can't do nothing, your actions will all be somehow compulsive. You can't really "do nothing," so it's really just not trying to make things happen. The _Do Nothing meditation_: stop yourself every time you catch yourself doing something, thinking, etc
