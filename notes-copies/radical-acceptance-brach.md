## Prologue

Trance of unworthiness:
- The antidote is radical acceptance
- The training in compassion and mindfulness that allows one to fully live in the moment and embrace life wholeheartedly

## 1 Trance of unworthiness

Manifestations of feeling unworthy:
- Addictions: work, etc
- Fear of rejection

We want to belong.
We blame ourselves and blame externally

insecurity can manifest as pride:
- we want to feel special
- we need constant, repeated validation

This shame and unworthiness is a universal feeling. Persists even after years of meditating

Spiritual ego - the ego using spiritual practices for its own purposes, a quest for "perfection" (as opposed to wholeness)

Culture makes us feel unworthy - feeling obligated to prove ourselves to belong to any group, even as small as family

We all have Buddha nature, but we feel banished - following the Adam and Eve story, believing we have original sin

Parenting
- Good: holding up a mirror so we can see our own goodness, feeling like we're "real"
- Bad: teaching that anger and fear are bad. Be special. Don't be needy

Taking risks: we repeatedly tell ourselves stories (make excuses), keep ourselves busy to avoid real growth / vulnerability

Making others the enemy:
Parents, bosses, politicians, other countries, directing anger

Roots of trance:
Buddha's insight: suffering is caused by believing that we're separate from others, that we're separate selves. We want things, we fear things. We define ourselves based on those wants and fears. That process can be called "I-ing" and "My-ing". **While want and fear are natural, they don't define us. They're just part of the experience of being alive in a body.**

"Bodhi dharma" - the teaching from the Bodhi tree

We're like uprooted trees, cut off from what nourishes us, trying to be free in the wrong ways (maladapted, neurotic)

Guided meditation: what do you dislike about yourself? Physical features, judgement of others, insecurities, selfishness, etc

What do you want others to think about you? What do you not want them to think of you? (How do you try to control their impressions of you?)

## 2 Awakening

We cage ourselves, incapable of taking the advantage of the freedom that's possible (learned helplessness)

Liberation comes from accepting everything in our lives

We tend to want more instead of accepting what we have (the reverse also true, we fear what we don't want)

2 wings of acceptance
- 1 - seeing clearly, without judgment
- 2 - compassion, caring for ourselves

Clear comprehension:
When we see clearly, we're able to see suffering. If we allow our hearts to guide us, we want to reduce suffering. We bring suffering upon ourselves

Author had a miscarriage while in her spiritual community. Her teacher publicly shamed her calling her out for being a professional and not being dedicated enough. She was devastated, but had a breakthrough. She could accept her flaws, despite the teacher's words

Author's mom was an alcoholic. Rock bottom was the turning point to awaken from the trance

Vulnerability:
Rumi: keep your gaze on the bandaged place, it's where the light enters

The teacher's "betrayal" was actually how author betrayed herself, trying to please others

Potential confusion, acceptance isn't:
- resignation or justification. Accepting allows us to change and grow
- giving up, giving into fear based stories. We can hope for the best, beyond our limitations

We see our deeper motivations more clearly and mindfully accept them. Addictions, outrage, fear, guilt - we can act decisively/intentionally rather than reactively through acceptance

**Self acceptance isn't acceptance that we are separate individuals.** Acknowledging the personal human experience allows us to impersonalize it

_Radical_, Radix, Root - core, origin of who we are, source of our being, which is love and openness, wakefulness

**Jung - spiritual journey destination: wholeness is the goal, not banishing the "evil". Unconditional love.**

Vipassana meditation. To see clearly. To see thoughts as just thoughts

Loving kindness meditation

Building walls, your freedom suffers with them. What if my boundaries dissolved? What if I accepted life just as it is?

Guided meditation, Vipassana
- Notice breathing, specific sensations
- Become aware of thinking, return to breath
- Notice sensations, emotions, be present with them

## 3 the sacred pause

High altitude flights are deadly. NOT trying to control the plane proved the best strategy for survival

You can pause at any time. (It feels radical to do nothing!)
This could be a retreat

This creates a space to respond creatively, thrive over survival
We can examine our feelings in the moment

**Do I NEED to urgently act? Usually not.**

Running from our shadows - impossible task, what we dislike/bury constantly follows us

Rejection is our hurt because we want to be accepted. We reject parts of ourselves out of shame

Lashing out is a way to run from your shadow.
Can become a vicious cycle of lashing out and feeling ashamed for doing so

- In his father's castle, Buddha was shielded from pain. He sought pleasure, then renounced pleasure. His meditation: he felt the suffering of all beings, but saw it as part of the beauty of life and found peace
- This is like us rejecting pleasure or pain instead of embracing our feelings / being whole
- **This is the middle way.**
- The god Mara is illusion - the illusion that arises from feelings that we get carried away with, the illusion of the self. Anger
Freedom was the awakening through awareness

**Art is in the pausing between notes** - Arthur Rubinstein

## 4 unconditional friendliness

Inquiry
- What are my bodily sensations?
- What is happening?
- What is asking for acceptance?

Naming / Noting what is happening. This acknowledges, makes you more aware

How am I suffering? (What am I longing for?)

Saying yes to everything we experience. It's not condoning. It's accepting

Smiling helps us say yes. It sends a signal to relax

**Yes - life is messy. We have angry, fearful, etc thoughts. That's all part of it.**

## 5 coming home to the body

Mindful awareness of bodily sensations, especially in a pause

Body affects mind, but we're often out of touch

**The root of every thought and feeling is a bodily sensation.** We assess it as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.

Inhabit the body, **don't observe as if outside the body and don't classify the separate parts**

Pain isn't the enemy, but culturally we reject pain / killing the messenger. Pain isn't necessarily suffering, but fear is a common reaction to it

Dissociation

## 6 desire

Buddhism isn't anti-desire. It's anti-clinging to experiences that are necessarily temporary

Being infatuated. It's not the goal to push away your longings. Relate to desire with acceptance and curiosity. **What is the wanting mind like?**

Nobody wants to suffer. We all want to be happy and thrive.
Desire is a force that moves our lives, that moves the whole world

Maslow - hierarchy of needs
(Link: POFE 4 levels are the needs)

We often confuse shorter term wants with our longer term deeper desires. We keep trying to get a fix instead of addressing what we really yearn for.

Chris: parents ignored and rejected him when he wanted attention. He played accordion for them and they left him alone. Later this manifested as needing to be seen as special, smart, talented etc. ! Desires tend to grow stronger and manifest in substitute ways when not fulfilled. Competing, people pleasing, etc become a part of our identities.

Substitutes: Workaholism / producing results. This is the wanting self clouding over our real desires (even if the same activity could've satisfied a deeper desire)

The trance: seeing everything as an opportunity to fulfill this substitute desire. Basically using people to gain selfish ends.

When we push our base desires away, we deny our very source of life

**"It's not my fault."** I didn't choose to be this way because I'm a bad person. **"This too"** when feelings arise, accept them all

Slowing down, that's a modified way to pause

Examining her erotic desire: there's a deep sadness and longing for love that was never received

What do you long for? Don't judge, accept whatever comes to mind. You can also do this with a partner

## 7 fear

Fear is anticipating pain from loss, danger to ourselves, etc

Fear of death is the root of all fears. We don't want to die. But when in the trance of fear, we are afraid more than we need to be

We tend to protect ourselves by tightening our bodies

When governed by fear, we see others as either threats or ways to mitigate our fears

Nurturing relationships: fear makes you feel isolated, this isolated feeling exacerbates it

## 8 awakening compassion

2nd wing: compassion

Self judgement trance

compassion means "to be with"

Bodhisatvas

**Starting your growth with either self compassion or for others is fine / doesn't matter.** Whatever's easier

**"I care about this suffering"** - aware of your bodily sensation / pain

If the pain/guilt is too great and you don't feel like you deserve compassion, you still do. Maybe you need a higher power to hold your pain.

Prayer in Buddhism: the loving kindness meditation is a form of prayer
- Mindful prayer: keeping our suffering in awareness.
- Prayer to the Universe, or some other entity (what would work for me?)

Pain and suffering have been entrusted to us, in a way. We need someone to "hold" us, in a way, in order to handle it.

## 9 widening compassion

Attention and love to others, animals
- After we can give compassion to ourselves
- Seeing others' suffering and vulnerability
- You can help and benefit others

The "other" - classifying someone by their demographic or character trait. This makes them less real to us and we can treat them inhumanely

What does the other need? **What does the other really need?**

Try seeing through their eyes, being in their body. How can I be more loving, kind?

## 10 - our basic goodness

Resentment
- we feel wronged because we believe we're bad in some way
- **We're not bad though. We're ignorant.** We ignore our awareness and capacity for love

Forgive your anger, shame, fear, grief. **Punishment doesn't make us better or more good**

See yourself through the eyes of one who loves you (a pet perhaps)

We can ask for forgiveness from others. In meditation and in real life

**Seeing the goodness in others.** Ask "who are you really?" How do you see someone if it's the last time you'll ever see them?

Loving kindness meditation

**We are gentle by nature.** It's our true nature

ask: **"Is this coming from a good place?"**

## 11 awakening together, relationships

**We need others.** We can't awaken and heal if isolated.

Sangha, community is essential to the practice of radical acceptance

Don't harm others. Right speech. Say what's true
(Eightfold path)

Insight dialogue. Listening and speaking (with others) meditation, **speak from silence**. Pausing, awareness of sensations.

Saying how you feel, being real and vulnerable around others

Interventions

Meditation groups who share their daily struggles. **It's not spiritual backsliding. It's part of the path, a call for greater awareness**

## 12 true nature

Mother of all Buddhas

Is this my small self or real self?

I am no longer a self, I'm pure awareness.
But awareness is still a self that's aware. Ask, who is aware?
The self is a collection of experiences, but that organization is arbitrary. We grasp for that grounding, but it's not real
(Alan Watts)

The search for happiness is what separates us from happiness. **Happiness is already there, we just need to relax all grasping and preconceptions and it will appear**

Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. This is a reminder that there's so much to life, but it's constantly in flux, we're empty and can't hold onto it because there isn't anything to hold onto

**Dzogchen meditation** !
