## Slow Productivity Overview

- Knowledge work often involves complex and overwhelming tasks.
- The author suggests focusing on a singular task to create relevance and coherence.
- Productivity is not about overload and busyness; it requires time and space.
- Newport defines slow productivity as a sustainable and meaningful approach to knowledge work.
- Principles include fewer tasks, natural pace, and quality obsession.

## Part 1: Foundations

## Chapter 1: The Rise and Fall of Pseudo-Productivity

- Pseudo-productivity, busy work in the knowledge sector, has become a proxy for productivity.
- Pseudo-productivity appeals to managers. They get a sense of "measurement" of output (borrowing from factory work) and work that is "seen" can be be measured.
- > Long work sessions that don’t immediately produce obvious contrails of effort become a source of anxiety—it’s safer to chime in on email threads and“jump on” calls than to put your head down and create a bold new strategy.
- The rise of computers and smartphones has led to a rush of work, causing burnout and a decrease in quality.

## Chapter 2: A Slower Activity

- True productivity occurs at a slow pace and is invisible.
- Reduced workweeks and being able to work slowly helps mitigate the worst aspects of pseudo-productivity.

## Part 2: Principles

## Chapter 3: Do Fewer Things

- Overhead tax, a back-and-forth messaging process, can lead to increased costs due to the frictionless nature of technology.

- Doing fewer things can yield better results, requiring self-regulation and limiting incoming requests.
- From largest to smallest: limit missions, projects, and daily goals to focus on a singular project.

strategies:

- Put tasks on autopilot: assign recurring work to specific times, days, and locations weekly. The idea is to contain tasks to complete them.
- Synchronize: replace asynchronous communication with real-time conversations. Not every task is worth a meeting, so don’t overschedule work sessions. Also, try to dedicate a specific timeframe for this purpose.
- Make other people work more: before others send more work your way, they should do more work themselves. Add friction to the process: create a shared document where you have limited tasks to complete. This gives structure to an often overwhelming pile of things but also implies that someone does some of the work before they involve you. A positive side effect of doing this is that it provides clarity so the requested work will probably be completed.
- Avoid task engines: choose the type of work that will generate fewer tasks and unnecessary back-and-forth exchanges. Task engines generate several urgent things to do, so simply avoid them.
- Spend money: this involves spending money on useful apps and services rather than getting the most out of free versions. As expensive as these tools can be, professional software services make a difference, especially in eliminating certain tasks.

Go from Push to Pull:

- Track all projects on a list divided into "holding tank" and "active" sections.
- New projects are placed in the holding-pen section of the list, with no bounds on the list size.
- Active list should be limited to three projects at most.
- When a project is completed, it can be removed from the list, leaving a free slot for a new project.
- For larger projects, a reasonable chunk of work towards its completion can be pulled onto the active list.

Intake Procedure
- When adding a new project to the holding tank, the source should be informed about what they should expect.
- An acknowledgment message should include a request for additional details, a count of existing projects, and an estimate of completion time.
- Transparency is key and promises should be delivered, even if they need to change.

List Cleaning
- Update and clean lists once a week.
- Review upcoming deadlines and prioritize what's due soon.
- Cleaning sessions provide an opportunity to remove languishing projects from the holding tank.
- The work itself provides reward, not rushing.

## Chapter 4: Work at a Natural Pace

- Author recalls the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture, which led to a monotonous and uniform work environment.
- Take longer for creative work to explore and develop.

Slowing Down Strategies:

- Make a five-year plan - when the timeline is long, changes in momentum and breaks don't derail the project
- Double project timelines - accept slower accumulation of smaller bits.
- Simplify workdays by scheduling fewer tasks and reducing appointments.
- Forgive self-procrastination, it will happen when timelines are longer.
- Embrace seasonality, varying work intensity and focus throughout the year.

Quiet (not-quite) Quitting Strategies

- Define a shorter work year: 10 instead of 12 months, for example.
- Implement "small seasonality": Avoid working frantically without rest, not on an entire season.
- Avoid meetings on Mondays: Suggest a different day for meetings when requested.
- See a matinee once a month: Reset your mind by going to a movie theater or going on hikes or visiting museums.
- Schedule rest projects for each major project to balance stress. Examples include watching movies, learning a language, or playing a musical instrument.
- Work in cycles: Work at higher intensity for 2-8 weeks. Then have a couple of weeks of "cool down" to work on small issues.

Space, Tools, and Rituals

- Match your space to complement your work.
- Work in "strange" places to reduce everyday distractions (like dishes and laundry)
- Use extravagant tools.
- Create striking rituals: These help spark creativity

> If organizations wanted to close down central offices, I proposed, they should reinvest this savings to help employees find places to work near their homes. By freeing these workers from the drag of the familiar, overall productivity and satisfaction would rise. Here I’m arguing that you keep something similar in mind during your individual efforts to create more poetic environments for your work. Strange is powerful, even if it’s ugly. When seeking out where you work, be wary of the overly familiar.
\
> In this account of ancient Greek Mystery cults, we learn something important about rituals in general. Their power is found not in the specifics of their activities but in the transformative effect these activities have on the mind. The more striking and notable the behaviors, the better chance they have of inducing useful changes.

## Chapter 5: Obsess Over Quality

> “Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do,” Jobs explained.
\
> We’ve become so used to the idea that the only reward for getting better is moving toward higher income and increased responsibilities that we forget that the fruits of pursuing quality can also be harvested in the form of a more sustainable lifestyle.

Quality:
- demands a slowing down approach, requires patience and commitment
- contrasted with quick returns and busywork
- is crucial for artists and knowledge workers, but often underestimated.
- is about simplicity, often replaced with "just enough".

Recommendations to narrow the gap in skills for producing great work:

- Become a cinephile: engage in high-quality leisure activities outside of your domain of expertise. Approach it with playfulness and openness. Example: cinema. Use different resources to understand what makes movies so good, such as books, reviews, or essays.
- Start your own "inklings" (Tolkien and CS Lewis): meet with someone (or a group) who has similar ambitions and you’ll soon find a way to improve your projects considerably.
- Buy a fifty-dollar notebook: spending a lot of money on high-quality equipment makes you more careful about the work you do with it. This is a way to signal to yourself that you’re taking that activity seriously.
- Write after the kids go to bed: work whenever you can, especially when you have a passion project. If you fail, nothing happens, but if you win, it can change your life. (Only do this temporarily!)
- Reduce your salary: if you rely on the side project you’re working on for money, you’ll be forced to focus. After all, failing to do so means you won’t be able to pay the bills. Of course, the idea is to wait until you know that the interest you’re pursuing has the potential to make some money.
- Announce a schedule: by announcing the work you’re doing before it happens (to one or more people), you create enough expectations that you’ll have to produce something notable.
- Attract an investor: when you get financial help from someone else, you’ll be able to have better production quality. Additionally, you’ll feel the need to pay back their trust.

## Conclusion

- John McPhee's writing method involves tackling one story component at a time, arranged on a plywood sheet.
- He takes relevant notes from the corresponding folder and places them on a card table, freeing him to focus on the material.
- McPhee compared his productivity to geological time, stating that he appears to do a lot of work but on a smaller scale, it feels like tiny accumulations.
- He believes that a six-day routine puts a small drop in a bucket each day, which is crucial for achieving productivity.

> A slower approach to work is not only feasible, but is likely superior to the ad hoc pseudo-productivity that dictates the professional lives of so many today. If you collect modest drops of meaningful effort for 365 days, McPhee reminds us, you’ll end the year with a bucket that’s pretty damn full. This is what ultimately matters: where you end up, not the speed at which you get there, or the number of people you impress with your jittery busyness along the way.
