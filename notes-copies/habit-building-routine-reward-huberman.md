[(56) Andrew Huberman: "The Billion Dollar Routine You Can Copy" - Stanford Neuroscientist - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&app=desktop&v=B8aXidTUnJc)

## Set 6 habits for yourself. Aim to do 4, maybe 5 a day. Don't compensate if you miss

## Reward System

- Dopamine: you want to aim for _intermittent_, not consistent rewards. You want to work _regularly_, only get rewarded once in a while.
- Especially true for _external_ rewards
- "Everyone gets a trophy" undermines rewards in every way. Leads to Parkinson's (which is lack of dopamine)

## 3 Phases of the day

Put habit types in advantageous parts of the day. Early part of day is phase1, later is phase2, sleep is phase3:
- Phase 1: 1-9 hours after wake up (high dopamine) do _linear habits_ - things that you know how to do or is a skill with predefined steps
- Phase 2: after 10 hours, do _nonlinear_ activity like creative work, creative writing, brainstorming etc. Developing skills that are more exploratary

## Fear is a more powerful motivator than success

Imagine the catastrophic effects of not doing this goal.

Success is something we don't pay attention to, so it slips our minds and we might mess up the next time. Failure makes us want to better next time.

## 85-15 ratio

strive to set up the difficultly of a task to be 85% success and 15% failure when learning/practicing skills.

## Depression and dopamine

“If someone is depressed, what they need to do is get up early and get some light in their eyes and get some movement ... You get that dopamine release early in the day. That’s antidepressive — you time your sleep better. When you get sun in your eyes and you get movement early in the day, for most people that’s accessible and they absolutely should be doing it ... But for people who are far enough down that path of depression, because the body and the mind have this relationship that’s so close, there is a crossover point where they really can’t do those activities because they’re so far deep into depression. The body won't do what they decide to do.”
