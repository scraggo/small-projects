## 1: The Essentialist

"Less, but better"

Visual:
You have, say, 100 units of energy. If you disperse it amongst 100 things, they each get 1 unit. But if you focus on one thing, it gets all 100 units, which is clearly more powerful.

The Paradox of Success:
Success leads to more opportunities. Most opportunities wind up being unimportant and steal our energy. Ironically, **we fail by becoming trapped by our successes** and taking on non essential opportunities.

We are sold a promise that we can have it all. But adding more never makes us happier.

Priority is singular. You can't have multiple priorities.

3 steps:
- Explore - Thoughtfully evaluate choices
- Eliminate - Eliminate what you don't love, isn't important, etc. What would you pay _now_ for the old shirt in your closet?
- Execute - turn the mindset into a system and make every choice an essentialist choice.

## 2: Choose—The Invincible Power of Choice

Options - there are usually more than you think, especially (worth considering) the option to stop doing what you're doing.

The _ability to choose_ is far more essential than the options you have. William James made his first act of free will believing in free will.

Learned helplessness - forgetting that you have the power of choice.

Taking on too much at work - we often don't realize we have a choice to not do that!

## 3: Discern—The Unimportance of Practically Everything

Discernment - 80/20 - the trivial many vs the vital few. The majority of opportunities presented are unimportant and have very low value. Start to recognize that!

Richard Koch - author of books on 80/20

## 4: Trade-Off—Which Problem Do I Want?

Trade offs

Don't adopt "straddling" strategies - where you incorporate conflicting strategies. Southwest vs Continental

Embrace the fact that you're sacrificing something and it creates a problem. Choosing the problem gives you more power than trying to do it all.

Better to look at it as "what do I want to go big on?"

## 5: Escape—The Perks of Being Unavailable

Escape

Make yourself regularly unavailable.

You need space, disconnected from gadgets and obligations, in order to determine what is essential.

Design spaces for thinking. Schedule blocks to be in those spaces.

Read timeless books - see list at end of chapter.

## 6: Look—See What Really Matters

Journalism: find the lead, don't regurgitate facts.
- facts: "Teachers are attending a conference"
- lead: "There's no school on Thursday."

Keep a journal. When you review it, look for patterns, find what matters to you.

Essentialists don't get hung up on details - they look for the big picture, they listen for what's -not- being said, they filter for what's fascinating.

Many times problems are presented one way (like, building a cheaper version of something) but actually need to be solved another way (like, actually building an incubator that doesn't use electricity.) A car isn't a faster horse.

Clarify the question - don't get sidetracked.

## 7: Play—Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child

Play lights up the brain, our best ideas come in a state of flow (play). It's essential to our wellbeing.

Ken Robinson - schools stifle creativity. The workforce does the same - borrowing methodology from the military.

What did you do during play as a child? How can you bring some of that to the present?

## 8 Sleep—Protect the Asset

"Protect the asset" - health comes first. Prioritize sleep for a myriad of reasons.

It's _easy_ to push yourself to your limits. It's _difficult_ to get enough sleep and to tell others you're unavailable. Quit glorifying being too busy and poorly rested.

You can determine what's essential better when you're well rested.

## 9: Select—The Power of Extreme Criteria

Hell yes or No - Sivers-style

90% rule - only choose the top candidates that match your _explicit_ criteria exactly. Don't get stuck with 60,70,80%

Implicit Criteria - non essentialists have unspoken criteria like, always doing what their manager says or what others are doing.

How to evaluate an opportunity:
- What are 3 _minimum_ criteria for it to pass? All 3 must pass.
- What are 3 _extreme_ criteria, of which 2 out of 3 must pass to even be considered?

## 10: Clarify—One Decision That Makes a Thousand

Having a mission statement can be inspiring, but it's not enough. You need an _Essential Intent_ - it has concrete action built into it. Example: "get everyone in the UK online by 2012."

Without this, people play politics, try to please the boss, follow their own opportunities, because they aren't clear on how to contribute to the bottom line.

An essential intent lets everyone know when the goal is achieved.

## 11: Dare—The Power of a Graceful “No”

We're afraid to say no for many reasons. We want to avoid social awkwardness. We think we'll damage the relationship.

Saying no fosters respect.

There are many graceful ways to say no.

## 12: Uncommit—Win Big by Cutting Your Losses

Don't give into the sunk cost fallacy

Endowment effect: we think things we own are more valuable than they are. Ask, what would I pay to get this if I didn't own it? It works for event invitations as well.

Get over the fear of waste. We have this instilled early on, it's another version of sunk cost.

Beware of status quo bias. Don't do things just because they've been done that way. Zero based accounting - don't make budgets based on last year's performance.

Reverse pilot - try _not_ doing something and see if people miss it.

## 13: Edit—The Invisible Art

Eliminating the non-essentials is becoming the editor of your life. Like being a sculptor chiseling a stone, removing distractions and what's non essential.

Deliberately subtract from your life, not add. Like film editing, make your story clearer.

- Cut out options: decision - "cut" (incision)
- Condense: fewer words, less waste
- Correct: you can fix when things go awry when your intentions are clearer
- Edit less: step back, observe, let things happen. You don't always need to intervene.

## 14: Limit—The Freedom of Setting Boundaries

Setting boundaries creates freedom. You make your non negotiable rules ahead of time and you'll know exactly how to communicate them.

Their problems aren't your problems. You don't have to water their grass with your hose.

Find your deal-breakers. Notice when you feel even slightly violated. This helps you concretize your boundaries.

Make a social contract. When you spell these out and agree on them ahead of time, it prevents a lot of conflict.

## 15: Buffer—The Unfair Advantage

The unexpected happens.

- Make contingency plans.
- Save extra money.
- Leave extra time at the end of your presentation.
- Get ready for the unexpected very much ahead of time.

Extreme preparation: get backups of essentials, start as soon as you know about a project. Pretend you're on a dangerous mission to a treacherous land.

Add 50% to all time estimates:
We tend to underestimate how long things take. There are many reasons for this, an important one being social pressures

Scenario planning. 5 risk identification and mitigation questions:
- What risks do you face?
- What's the worst case scenario?
- What would the social effects be?
- What would the financial impact be?
- How can you invest to reduce the above risks or strengthen resilience?

## 16: Subtract—Bring Forth More by Removing Obstacles

Theory of constraints: improve the least efficient part of the system and the overall system improves.

Herbie is the slowest hiker in a Boy Scout troop. Put him in front, remove weight from his backpack, and everyone can hike in concert. What are the "Herbies" in your life?

Aristotle posited three types of work, the third being "bringing forth." An essentialist brings forth by carefully identifying what must be subtracted, not by adding bandaids here and there.

1. be clear about the essential intent
2. list all the constraints
3. identify the primary constraint “What is the obstacle that, if removed, would make the majority of other obstacles disappear?”
4. remove the constraint(s) - be helpful by offering to remove constraints for others!

## 17: Progress—The Power of Small Wins

"...two primary internal motivators for people are achievement and recognition for achievement."

Police started giving "positive tickets" and youth crime went way down.

Being recognized is great motivation, so is making progress, however small.

Small wins are better than attempting a big flashy win. Going for flashy wins:
- is motivated by non-essential (egotistical) reasons
- fails more easily than small wins
- is very demotivating if you fail. We lose the opportunity to get to see progress as we go

Making small progress a habit, part of our daily routines, builds momentum.

Adopt a method of “minimal viable progress.” Ask yourself, “What is the smallest amount of progress that will be useful and valuable to the essential task we are trying to get done?”

3 tactics:
- MVP - minimum viable _progress_ (iterate, create small units of value)
- MVP - minimum viable _preparation_ (do a little bit of prep early, rather than a lot right before the deadline)
- Visually reward progress. For example, a progress meter that looks like a thermometer. It's fun to track progress this way

Take a goal or deadline you have coming up and ask yourself, “What is the minimal amount I could do right now to prepare?”

## 18: Flow—The Genius of Routine

Michael Phelps had a daily routine: visualize a perfect race after waking up and before bed. "Playing the tape."
He also had an incredibly explicit routine he followed exactly before races. This allowed him to focus on his goal: winning.

An essentialist encodes the behaviors they need to enact in routines. They stick to them instead of getting distracted by nonessential things.

Building a habit is making a behavior automatic. Synapses strengthen and it frees our mental resources, prevents decision fatigue.

Duhigg - Power of Habit. Cue, habit, reward. To ensure we have the _right_ habits, we need to examine the cues which cause undesirable behavior. Examples: Checking email first thing in the morning, scrolling social media, etc.
- Create new triggers - rewire the habit cycle. Find a replacement habit for the same cue.
- Do the hardest thing first - determine what that is first thing daily.
- Mix up your routines - you don't have to do the same thing every day. Jack Dorsey - theme every day of the week.
- Focus on one routine at a time. Don't overhaul everything at once - small progress is best.

## 19: Focus—What’s Important Now?

Non essentialists fixate on past mistakes and worry about the future. They're trapped in Chronos, the ever ticking clock.

Essentialists focus on the present and enjoy the moment. They pay attention to Kairos, the qualitative aspect of time, take advantage of opportune moments

Anecdote: author and wife decided to have a lunch together without planning and recapping their days. They just lived in the moment together. It was lovely and became an essential part of their routine.

Jiro dreams of sushi

You can't "multi-focus." You can multi-task, but you can only _focus_ on one thing at a time

**When you're not sure what to do right now, take some time to figure out what's important right now.** Make a list, don't do any items that aren't important.
List any future items and prioritize them.

Lao Tzu, Find joy in work, be present in family life.
TNH, Mindfulness invites happiness. Cultivate a beginner's mind.

## 20: Be—The Essentialist Life

Ghandi "reduced himself to zero" - ate only essentials, shed most of his possessions.

Essentialism is a way of life. The founders of the major religions renounced their worldly lives in an effort to find what's most important - usually to reduce suffering. Notable artists, politicians, and other figures have also followed that way of life.

Essentialism must be at the core of your being, not at the outside. Don't "major in minor activities" or fall prey to the paradox of success (fail because of your successes.) Core: essentialism becomes a mindset, you're emotionally motivated. "Metanoia" means _heart transformation_.

Author lists some essentialist choices he has made. Example: making time to talk to grandfather, less time on Facebook.

Choice: you realize you have a choice. When you make choices, you have more clarity, control, and joy:
- Clarity: by simplifying, what is meaningful stands out. Your life meaning becomes clearer.
- Control: you prioritize your life. Because when you don't, someone else will.
- Joy: you can really live in the moment and make memories according to the essentials.

Memento mori: life is short and precious. Essentialism reduces the chances of having regrets because you've eliminated what doesn't matter.

## appendix - leadership essentials

FCS:
- F - fewer things done better
- C - communicating the right things to the right people at the right time
- S - speed and quality of decision making
- (Pronounce FCS as "Focus")

Essentialist teams are aligned on their singular purpose. Each person knows what their singular priorities are and their role utilizes their strengths. It's clear what to work on, goals don't whimsically shift.
